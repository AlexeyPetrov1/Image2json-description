The bottles are labeled as \"bottle\" and have bounding boxes with coordinates [299, 237, 341, 392] and [299, 237, 341, 391] respectively. The bounding boxes indicate that the bottles are located in the center of the image, with the left arm holding a bottle and the right arm holding another bottle.",
